! Turn "Caps Lock" into Compose for typing fancy UTF-8 characters.
! To see all of the characters that you can type, run the command:
!     less $(locate en_US.UTF-8/Compose)

keycode 66 = Multi_key
clear lock

! Turn left "Alt" into Control so that Control and Alt are both
! accessible using my thumbs and without moving any of my fingers from
! home row - otherwise, Emacs will be the end of my wrists.

keycode 64 = Control_L
clear control
clear mod1
add Control = Control_L
add mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R

! Turn right-Ctrl, which I never use anyway, into a Greek key so that
! typing mathematics becomes easier.
